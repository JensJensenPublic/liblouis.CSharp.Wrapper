Note that the "bin" directory found in the LibLouis packet is per default ignored by GitHub.
For this reason a directory named "binary" has been created and all relevant files from the "bin" are copied to there.
The LIbLouisWrapper project will use the "bunary" directory instead of  the "bin" directory.
